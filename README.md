# TCM_NER_datasets
TCM NER dataset used in the paper "Named Entity Recognition for the Traditional
Chinese Medicine Text".We classify the TCM corpus into five types of named entities, namely: symptom (zz), syndrome (zh), crude drugs (yc), prescription (cf), and effect (gx). You can see them in label.txt. The number of named entities for each attribute is: symptom :5221, syndrome: 1435, crude drugs: 675, prescription: 1049, effect: 656. The dataset contains a total of 387,465 Chinese characters. We split the dataset into test and training sets in an 8:2 ratio.
