Since there is cur- rently a lack of publicly available large-scale TCMNER datasets, we collected and annotated a TCMNER dataset independently and used it to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance. We first used web scraping techniques to extract disease- related information from the website4, which includes brief descriptions of dis- eases, symptoms, causes, treatment methods, and others, as shown as Fig. 4. For the extracted text content, we initially cleaned it by removing duplicate sentences and characters that are not Chinese. Four clinical experts from China (chief physicians) used the YEDDA5 annotation tool to individually annotate text for four types of information using BIO tagging. This dataset contains a to- tal of 387,465 Chinese characters, with five types of entities: Symptoms, Causes, Herbs, Preparations(already prepared medicine), and Effects. The ratio of the training set, testing set, and validation set is 8:1:1. The entity counts for each attribute are shown in the Table 1.
